More than 60 percent of New Yorkers live in homes on or near these waterfront areas. \n\nThe importance of these coastlines will become more obvious as the sea continues to rise to levels never experienced by humans.\n\n A result of the world’s changing climate, a rising sea will alter more than just the coastline.
